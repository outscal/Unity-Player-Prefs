# Deleting PlayerPrefs

you can come inside the storage location and delete the values manually if you want to not have the saved values for any reason (for example, When the User wants to delete all saves and start a New Game) otherwise, there are 2 other ways to clear all values: 

- Use DeleteAll or DeleteKey functions using the C# script
- Use Clear All PlayerPrefs option under Edit category:
